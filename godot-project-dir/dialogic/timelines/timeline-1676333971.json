After all, if it wasn't for the service of the Horugaloos, the entirety of the Space-Time-Horu continuum would be in utter shambles! I mean, just really torn to shreds. Completely destroyed. Totally ruined. Uninhabitable! Strangely, more green than you might expect. This text intentionally overflows."
